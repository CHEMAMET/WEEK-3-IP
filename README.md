# Telecommunications Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes telecommunications usage data to identify patterns in voice, SMS, and data services across different cells and sites over a three-day period (May 6-9, 2012). The analysis provides insights into service usage patterns and recommendations for network optimization.

## Dataset Description
The analysis combines three similar datasets containing telecommunications usage records with the following key features:
- **Product**: Service type (Voice, SMS, Data)
- **Value**: Usage value/revenue generated
- **Date_Time**: Timestamp of the service usage
- **Cell_On_Site**: Cell configuration indicator
- **Cell_ID**: Unique identifier for each cell
- **Site_ID**: Unique identifier for each site
- **Geographic Information**: Location data for cells (when merged with geo dataset)

## Data Processing

### Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Dataset Combination**: Merged three similar datasets using `pd.concat()` for comprehensive analysis
2. **Data Type Conversion**: Converted `Date_Time` column to datetime format for time-based analysis
3. **Column Removal**: Dropped unnecessary columns (`Country_A`, `Country_B`) to streamline the dataset
4. **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated duplicate records to ensure data quality
5. **Geographic Merge**: Attempted to merge with geographic dataset for location-based insights

### Final Dataset Statistics
- **Total Records**: 15,001 entries
- **Data Quality**: Complete data for most columns, with 13,004 non-null Site_ID entries
- **Memory Usage**: 1.3+ MB

## Key Findings

### Service Usage Analysis
- **Voice Services**: Highest revenue generator with 312,532 total value
- **SMS Services**: Moderate usage with 53,427 total value  
- **Data Services**: Lowest usage with 17,287 total value

### Network Performance
- **Busiest Cell**: Cell ID `ffa6759bb2` with 1,996 usage records
- **High-Traffic Cells**: Several cells showing significant activity patterns
- **Geographic Distribution**: Analysis ready for location-based insights (pending successful geo-merge)

## Recommendations

### Business Strategy
1. **Voice Service Focus**: Continue investing in voice infrastructure as it generates the highest revenue
2. **Network Expansion**: Prioritize expanding capacity for high-traffic cells, particularly `ffa6759bb2`
3. **Data Service Growth**: Explore opportunities to increase data service adoption and revenue

### Technical Improvements
1. **Cell Optimization**: Expand capacity for the busiest cells to handle traffic efficiently
2. **Geographic Analysis**: Complete the geographic data integration for location-based insights
3. **Time-based Analysis**: Implement business hours vs. non-business hours usage pattern analysis

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **DateTime**: Time series data handling
